# Detection-of-Tuberculosis-using-Transfer-Learning

Hello!

I have attached a .ipynb file that contains the python code for detection of tuberculosis using transfer learning. 
After experimenting with many models and multiple preprocessing methods we decided to finalse
Dataset - TBX11K
Model - EfficientNetB3
Pre-processing - CLAHE, ImageDataGenerator
Visualisation - GradCAM

Thank you!
